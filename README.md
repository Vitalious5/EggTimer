# EggTimer

This was build for pure fun. The stack is very basic and uses simple and very basic HTML, CSS and Vanila Javascript approach. 

It can be open both on Desktop and Mobile (rsponsive) to track Eggs cooking levels. There are three possible cooking levels that user can set: Rare (4 minutes cooking time), Medium (6 minutes cooking time), Well Done (12 minutes cooking time).
